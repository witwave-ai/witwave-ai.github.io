# Anatomy of an Agentic Team

## Executive summary

Most discussions of AI in software engineering still treat the _team_ as a fixed constant: humans, organized the way
humans have always been organized, with AI bolted on as a productivity multiplier. That framing has a short shelf life.
Once agents stop being tools and start being members, the team's shape itself changes — not at the margin, but
structurally.

This paper describes the structural shape of a fully agentic engineering team, using a working eight-agent team as a
concrete reference, and contrasts it with the two team shapes most engineering organizations currently inhabit:

- **All-human teams.** The default. Coordinated by sprints, standups, tickets, and code review. AI absent or used as a
  personal IDE assistant.
- **Hybrid teams.** Humans plus AI agents-as-tools. Agents file PRs, agents drain backlog, but the team's coordination
  model is unchanged from the all-human case.
- **Agentic teams.** Humans set direction, quality bounds, and strategic intent. Agents _are_ the team. Coordination is
  agent-to-agent. The human's role is reframed from "do the work" to "shape the system that does the work."

The differences are not cosmetic. A mature agentic team can retire sprints, standups, ticket queues, calendar releases,
code-review queues, long-lived feature branches, much of the project-management SaaS stack, and fixed headcount math —
and replace them with heartbeat schedulers, persistent and _cross-readable_ decision logs, direct agent-to-agent calls,
velocity-based releases, in-code quality bars, a shared trunk every agent works from, a deliberately minimal
coordination toolset (memory files, RPC, git), and spec-defined membership. The substitutions are not optional polish
once agents are expected to behave as members rather than tools; they are what makes the operating model coherent. A
team that adopts agents but keeps the all-human coordination scaffolding gets the worst of both shapes — the cost of
agents without the leverage.

Three of these substitutions tend to surprise readers approaching the model for the first time, because they invert
defaults that human teams treat as load-bearing:

- **Operational memory is shared, not private.** Every agent can read the coordination state its peers write down. The
  shared surface is the coordination surface; sensitive data still needs explicit access control.
- **Everyone works from the same source.** No long-lived feature branches, no per-agent truth, no merge negotiation as
  the default operating mode. Every agent commits against trunk; the push is serialized through one peer.
- **The coordination toolset is tiny.** Three primitives — markdown memory files, an RPC call, git — replace the entire
  Jira / Confluence / Slack / Notion / Linear / Asana stack. Adding a tool to the coordination core should be treated as
  a tax, not a default improvement.

## The reference team

The patterns described in this paper are abstracted from a working agentic team: eight autonomous agents that maintain a
software platform, commit directly to `main`, and coordinate without human routing. Several additional specialist
members are designed for future expansion — see _The team in motion_ below — so the eight-agent shape captured here is a
current snapshot, not a final configuration. The reference is included here in full enough to stand alone; no outside
team roster is required to understand the model.

| Agent     | Substrate owned                                         |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Zora**  | Coordination. Decides who works on what, when.          |
| **Evan**  | Code defects and risks (security, reliability, perf).   |
| **Nova**  | Code hygiene — formatting, linting, missing docstrings. |
| **Kira**  | Documentation accuracy — public docs and release notes. |
| **Finn**  | Functionality gaps — what's missing relative to claims. |
| **Felix** | Feature implementation — new functionality end-to-end.  |
| **Iris**  | Git plumbing — push, CI watch, release pipeline.        |
| **Piper** | Outward voice — public updates, replies, moderation.    |

Each agent owns one substrate. Together they run the codebase continuously, shipping multiple small releases per day.
Humans set direction, raise the quality bar, and intervene on escalations the team flags upward. They do not route work,
attend standups, run sprints, or operate a ticket queue. None of those structures exist on this team.

## The six structural changes

There are many surface-level differences between agentic teams and the teams they replace. Most reduce to six structural
changes:

1. **Coordination becomes a peer role**, not a meeting cadence.
2. **Memory is persistent and cross-readable**, not private and ephemeral.
3. **Everyone works on the same source**, not on a fan-out of feature branches.
4. **The coordination toolset is minimal** — three primitives, not a SaaS stack.
5. **The quality bar lives in code**, not in a review queue.
6. **Membership is a spec**, not a hiring decision.

Each of these is a load-bearing change. Skipping any one of them produces a team that _looks_ agentic but inherits the
human-team bottleneck the change was supposed to retire.

### 1. Coordination becomes a peer role

In a traditional team, coordination is distributed across ceremony: standups, sprint planning, retrospectives, the
engineering manager's 1:1s, a project manager's status doc. Each ceremony is small, but together they consume a
nontrivial fraction of every engineer's week and a substantial fraction of the manager's. The cost is taken for granted
because there is no obvious alternative — humans need synchronization points, and ceremonies are how teams hold them.

In an agentic team, coordination collapses into a peer. One agent — the manager — runs a continuous decision loop on a
heartbeat (typically every 15–30 minutes). On each tick it reads team state, applies a priority policy, and dispatches
the right peer to the right work. There is no standup because there is no synchronization to perform: state is always
visible in the decision log; the manager already read it.

The shape difference is sharp:

| Dimension            | Traditional / Hybrid                | Agentic                                |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Coordination cadence | Daily standup + weekly planning     | Heartbeat (15–30 min)                  |
| Work assignment      | Ticket queue + manual pickup        | Manager dispatches via direct call     |
| Status visibility    | Standup updates + Slack threads     | Decision log + commit history          |
| Manager role         | Human in 1:1s, planning, escalation | Peer agent in continuous decision loop |
| Coordination cost    | ~10–20 % of every engineer's week   | Low human touch; mostly machine-time   |

The manager-as-peer pattern is what allows the rest of the structural changes to hold. It does not make coordination
free; it moves most coordination cost out of human ceremony and into compute, logs, policy, and exception audit. Without
it, work assignment falls back to either a ticket queue (which re-introduces queueing latency) or "every agent decides
for itself" (which produces collisions and duplicated work). The coordinator is what lets agents behave as a team rather
than a swarm.

### 2. Memory is persistent and cross-readable

A traditional team's state is fragmented across humans. Each engineer holds some context in their head; some lives in
tickets; some in design docs; some in chat history. The cost of this fragmentation is paid every day in standups, "quick
syncs," and the chronic slow leak of context when someone goes on vacation or leaves the team. Notebooks, scratch files,
and personal Notion pages are _private by default_ — humans guard their notes the same way they guard their inbox.

A hybrid team usually inherits this fragmentation directly — the AI agents participate in the same fragmented system,
posting to Slack and filing tickets that humans then summarize back into the human context. The agents may have session
memory, but it is per-agent and not legible to peers.

An agentic team treats memory as a first-class persistent surface — and crucially, **as a shared one**. Each agent
maintains its own memory namespace — markdown files indexed by topic — and every other agent can read the operational
state written there. The manager reads each peer's in-flight notes to know what's in progress before dispatching the
next tick. The release agent reads pending-push queues from peer memories to know what's about to land. The
outward-facing agent reads shared operational memory plus the manager's decision log to know what to talk about
publicly. There is no analog to a private notebook for coordination state; if it isn't written down where peers can read
it, it doesn't exist for the team.

Cross-agent state also lives in shared documents (a decision log, an escalations file, a deferred-decisions memo, a
bugs-from-users intake). These sit at well-known paths every agent already knows about.

Four properties follow from this design:

- **No state-loss across handoffs.** A peer dispatched at 3 a.m. and again at 9 a.m. has the same context. Human teams
  rarely match this without heavy ceremony, tooling, and discipline.
- **No "catch up after vacation."** Memory is the canonical context source; the agent that just spun up reads the same
  files the agent that ran four hours ago wrote.
- **Coordination without messaging.** When the manager wants to know what another agent is working on, it reads that
  agent's memory. No Slack ping, no status update, no interruption. The peer doesn't even know it was consulted.
- **Audit trails come for free.** Every meaningful decision was written down by the agent that made it, because writing
  was the only way to make it survive the next heartbeat — and writing it where peers could read it was the only way to
  make it useful to the team.

The result is that the team's _operational memory_ — what's been tried, what worked, what's in flight, what was deferred
and why — is queryable infrastructure rather than tribal lore. Humans benefit from this directly: reading a decision log
to catch up on a week's work is faster than the equivalent set of standups would have been.

The instinct from a human-team background is to recoil from "everyone reads everyone's notes" — it sounds like
surveillance, or like a violation of psychological safety. The analogy is useful as a warning but incomplete. Agents do
not have careers, reputations to protect, or political reasons to obscure their reasoning. Default-shared _operational_
memory is what enables the rest of the operating model; making coordination memory private would re-introduce the
overhead the team was designed to retire.

#### Safety and memory boundaries

Shared-by-default memory does **not** mean every byte an agent can see belongs in a shared file. The shared surface is
for operational coordination: what is in flight, what was tried, what decision was made, what risk was deferred, what
next action is blocked. Secrets, credentials, customer data, regulated data, private HR or legal context, and anything
that would create unnecessary blast radius should be handled by explicit policy: least-privilege access, redaction,
retention rules, and audit trails.

This distinction matters because "memory is shared" is the most easily misapplied part of the model. The team needs
enough shared memory to coordinate without pings; it does not need a universal data lake with every sensitive artifact
copied into it. The coordination surface should be broad. The data surface should be deliberately bounded.

Shared memory also needs maintenance. Agents can write stale assumptions, duplicate notes, contradictory conclusions, or
overly broad summaries just as humans can. A mature team needs memory hygiene: compaction, contradiction checks,
expiration rules, decision-log cleanup, and periodic review of whether the memory surface still reflects how the team
actually works. This is one reason the Process Architect matters as the team grows; improving memory quality is process
work, not just storage work.

### 3. Everyone works on the same source

A traditional team's source-code workflow is fan-out by design. Each engineer branches off `main`, works for hours or
days in isolation, opens a pull request, debates the diff in review, addresses comments, rebases, eventually merges. The
branch model exists because parallel work would otherwise collide in the working tree and because review needs a stable
surface to inspect.

A hybrid team typically extends the same model to its agents — agents file PRs from agent-named branches into the same
review queue. The branch overhead remains; only the author changes.

An agentic team collapses the fan-out. In the reference model, there are no long-lived feature branches and no PR review
queue as the default path for work. Every agent commits against trunk. There is one canonical working checkout that the
team operates against; the push to `origin/main` is serialized through one peer (the release agent) so race conditions
and force-push hazards stay in one pair of hands.

This is only safe because the prior structural changes hold:

- The quality bar runs on every commit (see §5), so a commit landing directly on trunk has already cleared the gates
  that PR review would have enforced.
- Commits are atomic and small (the development style is trunk-based by policy), so the blast radius of any single
  commit is bounded.
- The serialized push posture means conflicts surface at one well-defined point and are handled by one specialist,
  rather than spreading across every agent's local checkout.
- The shared memory layer (see §2) means peers always know what others are about to commit, so concurrent work that
  touches overlapping files is noticed _before_ it diverges, not after.

The implications are large. There is no merge-conflict choreography. There is no PR-review backlog. There is no "rebase
this on main and re-request review" loop. There is no stale-branch graveyard. The team's working surface is the same
surface the user installs from — every commit is intended to improve it or be reverted quickly.

This change is structurally tied to trunk-based development as a discipline. The reference team goes further than the
usual "short-lived branch" form of trunk-based development by treating trunk itself as the coordination surface. Teams
that put agents on long-lived or review-gated feature branches tend to either (a) drown in PR-review queue, recreating
the hybrid-team plateau, or (b) accumulate a graveyard of half-finished agent branches that nobody owns. The
shared-source model is what lets the other changes pay off.

### 4. The coordination toolset is minimal

A traditional engineering organization runs on a stack of coordination tools that has grown by accretion: Jira (or
Linear, or Asana) for tickets; Confluence (or Notion) for design docs; Slack (or Teams) for chat; GitHub (or GitLab) for
code review; Google Docs for one-off writeups; calendar invites for meetings; a wiki for onboarding; sometimes a
separate "engineering handbook" repo on top. Each tool was added to solve a real problem; none was removed when the next
one arrived. The cumulative cost — license fees, context-switching, search-across-N-systems, the "where did we decide
that?" problem — is large and largely invisible.

A hybrid team typically uses the same stack and connects agents to it. Integrations multiply: agents need GitHub access
_and_ Jira access _and_ Slack access _and_ Confluence access; each integration has its own auth, its own rate limits,
its own failure modes.

An agentic team operates on three primitives, and stops there:

- **Markdown memory files.** Per-agent namespaces plus a small set of shared cross-cutting documents (decision log,
  escalations, intakes). Plain text on a filesystem. No SaaS account.
- **A single agent-to-agent RPC call.** One verb: "send this prompt to that peer; give me the reply." This is the entire
  work-assignment surface.
- **Git.** The source of truth for code, configuration, and identity. Every agent commits and reads from the same
  repository.

That's the toolset. There is no ticket tracker. There is no chat platform. There is no separate documentation system —
documentation lives in the same source tree under the same history. The operating manual is checked in alongside the
code. Onboarding a new agent is reading the same files everyone already reads.

The minimalism is not asceticism; it is structural. Every tool added to the coordination surface is a place where state
can hide from peers, a place where auth can fail, a place where one agent's view diverges from another's. The
three-primitive surface keeps state legible to every member by construction. Memory is a file at a known path; identity
and configuration are in git; every agent knows where the coordination state lives.

The diagnostic test for whether a tool belongs in the coordination surface: _if every agent can't read it, write to it,
and reason about it without glue code, it probably doesn't belong in the core._ Many SaaS tools are still useful at the
edges — customer support systems, incident tooling, analytics, CRM, billing, community surfaces — but they should remain
integration boundaries rather than the source of truth for how the team coordinates.

### 5. The quality bar lives in code

In a traditional team, code review is the load-bearing quality gate. Reviewers read diffs, ask questions, push back on
patterns, catch bugs. The cost is high (reviewer time is the most expensive throughput-limiter on most teams) and the
coverage is uneven (reviewers vary in attention, expertise, and how busy they are this week).

In a hybrid team, agents typically file PRs into the same review queue, amplifying the bottleneck — agents produce work
faster than humans can review, so the queue grows, attention per PR shrinks, and review quality decays even as
throughput rises.

In an agentic team, the bar is moved into automation that runs on every commit:

- Compilers, type checkers, linters, formatters, and the full test suite run on every change.
- Security scanners (CVE, secret detection, insecure pattern matching) run on every change.
- Domain-specific quality skills run before the commit lands — "is this a fix for a bug in this category, with the right
  shape?" — and refuse to commit work that fails the skill's fix-bar.
- Risky candidates flag _upward_ for human review rather than auto-fixing. The team's safety bar is "land what passes;
  surface what doesn't."

What stays in human review is a much smaller surface: architectural change, strategic redirection, novel patterns the
existing skills don't cover. Most commits land on `main` without per-commit human review because the gates the review
was meant to enforce already ran.

This change is the one most often dismissed as wishful. Engineers reasonably ask: how can I trust agents to commit
without review? The honest answer is that trust is built by watching the gates, not the agents. If the test suite is
strong, the linters strict, the security scanners current, the fix-bar enforced, and rollback cheap, then the agents are
constrained by the same automation that constrained the humans, only more consistently. If the gates are weak, human
review becomes a narrow and expensive backstop rather than a reliable system; the team may already be shipping bugs and
just not know which ones.

### 6. Membership is a spec

Adding an engineer to a traditional team is a months-long process: req approval, sourcing, interview loops, offer,
notice period, onboarding, ramp-up. The sunk cost is high enough that team composition changes slowly and deliberately,
and the political weight of "we need to hire" or "we need to restructure" is significant.

In an agentic team, an agent is a directory: an identity description, a set of behavioral instructions, a list of
skills, a routing config. Adding a member is hours of work, not months. Removing one is a deployment change.
Restructuring is a config change.

The implication is not "headcount becomes infinite." Each agent costs LLM inference, infrastructure, and human attention
to its escalations. The implication is that _team shape becomes a design surface_, evaluated and revised continuously,
rather than a rigid org chart locked in by hiring decisions made years ago. Roles can be specialized narrowly because
adding a specialist is cheap. The reference team has separate agents for code defects, hygiene, docs, gaps, git, and
outreach because the cost of separating them is low and the benefit (each agent's skills can be deeply specialized for
its substrate) is real.

The roadmap for the reference team includes specialist agents for infrastructure, agent-resource management, security
architecture, testing, software architecture, CTO-level direction, and deeper community engagement. Whether each one
ships, when, and in what shape, is a design decision the existing team can revise — not a hiring plan that requires
board approval.

## Evidence and boundaries

This paper is a design argument grounded in a working implementation, not a universal benchmark result. The strongest
claim is not "every organization should copy this exact team tomorrow." The strongest claim is narrower and more useful:
once agents become members rather than tools, the coordination model has to be redesigned around what agents can do that
humans cannot do cheaply — run continuously, read shared operational state, accept structured dispatch, commit in small
atomic pieces, and enforce rules consistently.

There is adjacent evidence for the components of the model. Public multi-agent software-engineering systems have shown
that role specialization and structured agent coordination can produce coherent software work. Agent-computer-interface
research has shown that the tools and surfaces agents use shape their effectiveness. Delivery research has long favored
small batches, continuous integration, automated gates, fast feedback, and recoverability over large-batch release
queues. Memory research increasingly treats persistent context as a first-class capability for autonomous agents.

Those comparisons are useful, but they are not the same claim. Many public systems demonstrate agents completing bounded
tasks. This paper is about an operating model: how an agentic team coordinates, remembers, ships, measures itself, and
changes its own composition over time.

What has not been proven is just as important: there is not yet broad evidence that every organization, codebase,
regulatory environment, or risk profile should run a fully agentic team in this exact shape. The reference team
demonstrates operational feasibility for one shape of software platform. It does not prove universal productivity gains,
universal safety, or universal suitability. Any serious adoption should measure outcomes, constrain the blast radius,
and make the human accountability path explicit.

## How this differs from prior multi-agent software engineering systems

The closest prior work is not traditional project management. It is the recent wave of multi-agent software-engineering
systems: virtual software companies, SOP-driven coding teams, conversational agent frameworks, and coding agents with
specialized computer interfaces. Those systems establish the important premise that role-specialized agents can
coordinate, generate code, review one another's work, use tools, and improve output quality through structured feedback.

This paper starts from that premise and asks a different question: _what happens when the multi-agent workflow stops
being a task demo and becomes the standing engineering team?_

That shift changes the object of design:

- Prior systems usually optimize for **task completion**. This paper optimizes for **team operation over time**.
- Prior systems often model a **software-development process**. This paper models an **engineering organization**:
  coordination, memory, release, documentation, public voice, human escalation, measurement, and membership.
- Prior systems generally use roles inside a bounded run. This paper treats roles as **deployed members** with
  persistent identity, memory, schedules, and ownership.
- Prior systems show that structured communication helps agents collaborate. This paper argues that a standing team
  should minimize communication by making operational state directly readable.
- Prior systems rely on workflow design. This paper adds **org-design pressure**: which substrates deserve agents, when
  the team should split roles, how it should retire roles, and how the process itself can be improved by a Process
  Architect.

In that sense, the paper is downstream of the benchmark literature but not redundant with it. The benchmark question is:
can agents solve software tasks? The operating-model question is: if they can, what shape should the team around them
take?

## What this changes about the human role

The agentic team does not eliminate the human. It reshapes the human's job in ways that are easy to mis-describe.

What the human stops doing:

- Running standups, sprint planning, retros.
- Routing tickets, managing the backlog queue, prioritizing work for the day.
- Reviewing routine commits — formatting, refactors, hygiene fixes, gap fills, documentation refreshes.
- Cutting releases on a schedule.
- Tracking who is working on what, who is blocked, who needs help.
- Most of the writing-down-what-happened that consumes manager time today.

What the human starts doing more of:

- **Setting direction.** What should the team build next quarter? What initiatives matter? What's deprecated?
- **Setting bounds.** What's the safety envelope each agent operates within? When should an agent flag for human review
  instead of auto-fixing? What's the quality bar?
- **Auditing the system, not the work.** Reading the decision log, checking the escalation surface, watching the
  metrics. The unit of attention is the team's operating model, not individual diffs.
- **Responding to escalations.** Truly novel situations, ambiguous trade-offs, decisions the agents flagged as
  out-of-distribution.
- **External-facing trust work.** The relationship with users, executives, peer teams. The agents can speak on public
  community surfaces, but the human is still the one accountable for what the team ships.
- **Evolving the team itself.** Adding agents, retiring agents, refining skills, tightening or loosening bounds. The
  team is a system the human now designs, not a roster the human now manages.

A useful way to think about the change: the human's job moves from being _inside the loop_ (doing the work, routing the
work, reviewing the work) to being _outside the loop, designing it_ (setting what the loop optimizes for, what
guardrails it operates within, what comes back upward when judgment is required).

This is not a reduced role. It is a different role, and one most engineering organizations are under-staffed for today
because the existing engineering manager and tech-lead role descriptions assume an inside-the-loop posture.

---

## When not to use this model yet

The fully agentic model is not the right starting point for every team. It is especially risky when the surrounding
engineering system cannot absorb fast autonomous work. Teams should slow down, narrow the scope, or stay hybrid if any
of these conditions are true:

- The test suite, type checks, security scans, observability, or rollback path are weak.
- The codebase has no clear ownership boundaries and small changes routinely have surprising cross-system effects.
- The organization cannot yet define who is accountable for an agent's output.
- The work involves sensitive, regulated, or customer-private data without access control, retention, redaction, and
  audit already in place.
- LLM cost, concurrency, rate limits, and failure modes are not monitored.
- The human team is not willing to retire any existing coordination surface, producing tool sprawl instead of leverage.

In those environments, the right move is usually not "no agents." It is a smaller version of the model: one substrate,
one agent, one safe write surface, one measurable loop. Let the operating system earn trust before it gets more
autonomy.

## Six failure modes

Most teams that try to assemble an agentic operating model without thinking about it structurally fall into one of six
failure modes — one for each structural change skipped. Naming them helps to avoid them.

### Failure mode 1: agents on top of human process

The team adopts agents but keeps the standup, the sprint, the ticket queue, the review backlog. Agents file PRs into the
same review queue humans use. Agents take work from the same Jira board.

The result is the Phase-2 plateau described in _The Three Phases of Agentic AI Adoption in Software Engineering_: agent
throughput is high, cycle time barely moves, the review queue grows, engineers feel less productive even as commit
counts rise.

The diagnostic question: _what did the team retire when it added agents?_ If the answer is "nothing," the team is in
failure mode 1.

### Failure mode 2: agents without a coordinator

The team gives each agent a domain and lets each agent decide for itself when to act. There is no manager peer; there is
no priority policy.

The result is collision and duplicate work. Two agents converge on the same file. Hygiene runs while a defect fix is in
flight and clobbers the fix. Releases cut while a risk-work skill is mid-investigation. The team produces a lot of
activity and not much coherent output.

The diagnostic question: _who decides the order of operations?_ If the answer is "each agent for itself," the team is in
failure mode 2.

### Failure mode 3: private memory

The team gives each agent a memory namespace but keeps it private to that agent. Agents communicate by sending messages
rather than by reading each other's notes. The manager pings each peer to ask "what are you working on?" on every tick.

The result is that the coordination overhead the shared-memory model was designed to retire reappears as message
traffic. Every dispatch decision requires a round of pings. Peers interrupt each other. Context is duplicated across
messages instead of being read from a single source. The team behaves like a Slack-bound human team that happens to have
agents in the channel.

The diagnostic question: _can the manager decide who to dispatch next without sending any messages?_ If the answer is
no, the team is in failure mode 3.

### Failure mode 4: feature-branch agents

The team puts agents on a feature-branch workflow. Each agent works on its own branch, opens a PR, waits for the next
agent (or a human) to review.

The result is usually one of two outcomes, both bad. Either humans are required as reviewers, in which case the team is
in failure mode 1 (review queue bottleneck) by another route — or agents review each other's PRs, in which case the team
accumulates a graveyard of stale agent branches that nobody owns and nothing ever lands quickly. The branch model works
against machine-time velocity.

The diagnostic question: _do commits land on `main` directly, or via a long-lived review queue?_ If the latter, the team
is in failure mode 4.

### Failure mode 5: weak quality gates

The team has agents, has a coordinator, has shared memory, has a trunk workflow, but the quality bar is enforced by
human review rather than by automation. The team commits enthusiastically, humans struggle to keep up with the review
load, the quality bar slides, regressions land, trust in the agents collapses, and the team retreats to failure mode 1
(agents-as-tools-with-mandatory-review) or abandons the experiment.

The diagnostic question: _what gates a commit before it lands on `main`?_ If the answer is "a human reviewer," the gate
is likely to become the bottleneck as throughput rises.

### Failure mode 6: tool sprawl

The team builds the agentic operating model and then bolts the existing SaaS stack onto it anyway. Agents file Jira
tickets _and_ update memory. Agents post status to Slack _and_ commit to git. Agents write Confluence pages _and_
maintain checked-in documentation.

The result is two sources of truth for everything, kept in sync by glue code that breaks on every API change. State
diverges. The "where did we decide that?" problem returns. The agents spend a meaningful share of their compute doing
format-translation work that produces no platform value.

The diagnostic question: _for any piece of team state, is there exactly one place it lives?_ If the answer is "no, it's
also in $TOOL," the team is in failure mode 6.

## A side-by-side comparison

The clearest way to see the structural shift is on a single page.

The pattern is consistent: every row where the agentic column differs, it differs because a human-coordination structure
has been replaced by a system that does the same job mostly in machine-time. The substitutions are observable in the
reference team today; the broader claim should still be measured in each environment that adopts them.

## Measuring whether it works

The model should not be evaluated by agent activity alone. Commits, messages, and generated lines of code are easy to
count and easy to inflate. The useful question is whether the operating model improves the system around the agents.

Useful measures include:

- Lead time from identified need to shipped change.
- Deployment frequency and release batch size.
- Change failure rate, rollback rate, and mean time to recovery.
- Human audit time per accepted change.
- Escalation rate and time-to-human-decision for escalations.
- Cost per accepted change, including failed or abandoned runs.
- Rework rate: how often agents or humans need to repair recently landed work.
- Stale-memory rate: how often decisions, queues, or in-flight notes are out of date.
- Duplicate-state count: how many places the same coordination fact has to be maintained.

The measurement posture is simple: if the team is producing more motion but not shorter cycle time, better
recoverability, lower human coordination load, or clearer accountability, it has not become more agentic in the
meaningful sense. It has only become busier.

## What does _not_ change

It would be misleading to suggest agentic teams are wholesale replacements for human engineering organizations. Several
things stay human, and most likely will for a long time:

- **Strategic direction.** What product to build, what market to enter, what to deprecate.
- **The quality bar itself.** Agents enforce the bar; humans set what the bar is. Tightening or loosening it is a human
  judgment call.
- **Trust relationships with the outside world.** Customers, regulators, executives, partner teams. The team can speak
  through agents, but accountability remains human.
- **Truly novel decisions.** Architectural pivots, new categories of work, responses to situations the existing skills
  weren't designed for. The team is good at the work it knows; humans are still the source of "we should be doing
  something fundamentally different."
- **The system itself.** The agentic team is not self-bootstrapping. Someone designed it, someone evolves it, someone is
  accountable for its behavior.

The agentic team makes the routine work of building and maintaining software into infrastructure. It does not make the
_judgment_ of what to build into infrastructure, and shouldn't be evaluated as if it claimed to.

---

## The team in motion

The eight-agent reference team is a starting shape, not a finished one. The current split (coordination, defects,
hygiene, documentation, gaps, features, git plumbing, outreach) is the smallest configuration in which the operating
model is internally coherent — every load-bearing function has an owner, and no agent is doing two jobs at once. It is
enough to _demonstrate_ the model. It is not enough to _cover_ the model's full surface.

Several specialist members are plausible next additions. Each fills a substrate the current team handles thinly or not
at all:

- **Infrastructure / platform-build agent.** Owns the build system, CI/CD pipelines, observability infrastructure, and
  deployment surface of the platform itself. Distinct from the git-plumbing agent (which _uses_ the build process to
  publish releases): this agent improves the build process, shaves CI minutes, evolves the deployment posture. Every
  minute it removes from CI is multiplied across every other agent's commit.
- **Resource-management agent.** The infra-level lifecycle layer for the agents themselves — scales pods up and down
  based on backlog, watches LLM cost and compute budgets, tunes per-agent timeout and concurrency configuration based on
  observed run patterns. Coordinates with the manager on team capacity but operates one layer below: the manager
  dispatches _work_ to agents; this agent keeps the agents _runnable_. Becomes load-bearing as the team grows past five
  or six members and per-agent tuning starts to dominate operator attention.
- **Process Architect.** Owns the team's operating system: skill design, schedule tuning, coordination rules, workflow
  automation, and small scripts that make every other agent more effective. Distinct from the coordinator, which decides
  what work runs next; this agent improves the machinery the coordinator and peers use to run work at all.
- **Security agent.** Higher-level security work that goes beyond the defects-and-risks agent's automated lens — threat
  modeling against the architecture, manual audit response, RBAC posture review, supply-chain analysis, compliance
  gap-finding. The defects agent covers the high-volume automated surface (CVE scans, secret detection, insecure pattern
  matching); the security specialist reasons about the system's overall threat posture, the work that requires
  architectural understanding rather than scanner output.
- **Testing agent.** Writes new tests where untested code paths surface, evaluates test-suite quality, surfaces
  flakiness and regressions, generates property-based tests for boundary code. The exact scope is still being designed —
  testing is one substrate that splits naturally into several shapes (test authoring, test-quality evaluation, mutation
  testing, E2E maintenance), and each is a different agent.

Beyond that next wave, additional specializations are sketched for software architecture (system-shape watching),
CTO-level direction-setting, and community liaison (deeper external engagement than the outreach agent provides).

The point worth highlighting is that this growth path is **cheap, reversible, and continuously revisable** — and that
property is itself a vindication of the "membership is a spec" structural change. Adding the infrastructure agent will
not require headcount approval, a six-month hiring loop, or an onboarding plan. It will require defining the substrate,
writing an identity document, scaffolding a skill or two, configuring the routing, and deploying a worker.

As the team matures, even the act of adding a new agent becomes agent-assisted. The Process Architect can propose the
new role, draft the identity, adjust schedules, update skills, and change coordination rules. The resource-management
agent can evaluate whether the system has enough budget, concurrency, storage, and runtime capacity to support the new
member. The human still approves the expansion and owns the safety envelope, but the design work and operational
preflight become part of the team's own machinery.

If the agent's substrate turns out to be wrongly scoped, it will be revised the same way: edit the spec, redeploy. If it
turns out the substrate doesn't deserve a dedicated agent at all, the work folds back into a peer's skill set and the
agent is retired.

This continuous-revision shape has implications worth naming explicitly:

- **The team's composition is a design problem, not an HR problem.** Should defects and risks be one agent or two?
  Should hygiene split into formatting and documentation hygiene? Should the manager fork into short-cycle dispatch and
  long-cycle release decisions? These are architecture questions answered with experiments measured in days, not
  organizational changes negotiated over quarters.
- **Substrates get narrower over time.** As the team grows, each agent's substrate gets sharper. The current defects
  agent covers both correctness bugs and risks; once the team is larger, those will likely split. The current outreach
  agent moderates public replies _and_ writes posts _and_ triages bug reports from users; eventually those become
  separate roles. Specialization compounds.
- **The team can grow into work that doesn't exist yet.** When the platform acquires a new surface — a new tool
  component, a new client interface, a new external integration — adding an agent to own it is a normal step, not an
  exceptional one. The team is not a fixed roster sized to current scope; it is a scaffolding designed to extend with
  the platform.

The reference team is, in short, deliberately early. Eight agents, not eighty. The shape will look different in a year.
That it _can_ look different in a year — at the speed of a config change rather than the speed of an org-design cycle —
is the point.

## Conclusion

The all-human team is well understood. The hybrid team is what most organizations have today. The agentic team is the
shape that becomes structurally coherent once agents are members rather than tools — and it diverges from the prior
shapes not at the margin but along every axis that defines how teams operate.

The six structural changes — coordinator-as-peer, cross-readable memory, shared trunk source, minimal coordination
toolset, in-code quality bars, and spec-defined membership — are load-bearing. Skipping any one produces a team that
looks agentic and behaves hybrid. Adopting all six pushes routine coordination into machine-time and lets human members
spend their attention on direction, bounds, and audit rather than on routing and review.

Engineering leaders evaluating their team's shape over the next few years should ask six questions, one per change:

1. **What did we retire when we added agents?** If the answer is "nothing," the team is paying the cost of agents
   without claiming the leverage.
2. **Who decides the order of operations?** If the answer is "each agent for itself" or "still the human PM," the team
   is missing the coordinator role that makes agentic operation coherent.
3. **Can the manager decide who to dispatch next without sending any messages?** If not, memory is private when it
   should be shared, and coordination overhead has crept back as message traffic.
4. **Do commits land on `main` directly, or via a long-lived PR queue?** A review-gated queue re-introduces the
   human-throughput bottleneck the trunk model was designed to retire.
5. **What gates a commit before it lands?** If the answer is "a human reviewer," the gating layer is likely to become
   the bottleneck quickly. The bar has to live in code.
6. **For any piece of team state, is there exactly one place it lives?** If state is duplicated across SaaS tools and
   the agent-native surface, the team is paying tool-sprawl cost on top of agent cost.

The teams that answer these questions deliberately — and redesign the operating model around the answers — will run
engineering organizations that look fundamentally different from the ones they replaced. That difference is the point.
Bolting agents onto a team designed for humans produces marginal gains. Designing a team around what agents enable
produces a different operating model entirely.
